**5. Accounts: **Every user needs to sign up to be able to post anything on the site. 

Static files are used to be able to link the stylesheets, Javascript,etc. 
Each particular folder has a urls.py file wherein the linking between various tabs is done.
To run these files locally ensure you have django/python and bootstrap installed I have used some other libraries like Misaka so do not forget to pip install them as well. Once done setting up the project and application using django-admin. Run the command python manage.py runserver to be able to locally run the website.
